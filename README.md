The code I wrote for this project can be found at:

- <https://github.com/larsks/py-mpu6050>
- <https://github.com/larsks/py-mpu6050-client>

This project depends on several other projects:

- Micropython: <https://micropython.org/>

    Micropython is a version of the Python language ported to run on
    embedded processors (such as the ESP8266).

- Vispy: <http://vispy.org/>

    Vispy is a high-performance 2D/3D visualization library for
    Python.

- i2cdevlib: <https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib>

    i2cdevlib is an Arduino library that includes code for interacting
    with the MPU6050.  While I haven't used any of the code in this
    project, I found the code to be a very useful reference.
